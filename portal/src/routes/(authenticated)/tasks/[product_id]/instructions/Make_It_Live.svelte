<h4>Notes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If the app uses one of the Restricted Users setting in Security, then you will need to provide instructions on how a reviewer can gain access.</li>
  <li>
    If your app isn&#39;t specifically targeted to appeal to children (like a Children&#39;s Bible or Bible stories picture book), then you should specify that it is intended for 13+ otherwise there are additional regulations that have to
    be met.
  </li>
</ol>
